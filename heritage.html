                        <div class="hema">Maharaja Jai Singh was a reputed astronomer. Emperor Muhammad Shah commissioned him to rectify the astronomical tables and to validate the data available on the positions of the planets. Jai Singh then built Jantar Mantar in seven years. This edifice was restored in the year 1901 and was declared as a national monument in the year 1948. The fascinating structure Jantar Mantar is completely made up of marble and stone. There are in total fourteen geometric devices in this observatory. These devices are used for computing the time of the day, predicting eclipses, the position of constellations, and the heights of celestial bodies.These geometric devices are bit complex to understand but they are mainly used to calculating the time is the major purpose. For instance, Samrat Yantra is a sundial, which can tell the time with an accuracy of only two-second difference from the local time of Jaipur.</div>
